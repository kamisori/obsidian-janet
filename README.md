# Obsidian Janet

Obsidian Janet is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) that lets you run [Janet](https://janet-lang.org/) code blocks.

The main usecase for this plugin is scripting in the context of your vault documents.


## Pre-requisites

You'll need to have [Janet](https://janet-lang.org/docs/index.html#Installation) installed for `janet` codeblocks.

You need to set absolute paths for `janet` in the plugin settings before evaluating code blocks.
You can find these paths using the `where` command in the terminal.

If you come from a Lisp background but are not familiar with Janet, keep in mind that Janet has differences from Lisp.
Take a look at the Janet docs to learn more about what's available.
